- A cloud provider account with appropriate permissions to create and manage resources.
- Ansible, Terraform, Vagrant, VirtualBox installed on your local machine.
- A valid SSH key pair for authenticating with the remote servers.

## Getting Started

To get started, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine:

    `git clone https://github.com/creatif-studio/boilerplate-deployer.git`

2.  Navigate to the `ansible` directory and create the necessary environment-specific variable files for your deployment. See the README.md file in that directory for more information.

3.  Navigate to the `terraform` directory and create the necessary `terraform.tfvars` file for your deployment. See the README.md file in that directory for more information.

4.  Initialize the Terraform working directory:
